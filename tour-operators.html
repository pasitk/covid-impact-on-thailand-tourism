                Cash crisis for Thailand's tour operators

            <div class="sub-headline">
                In today's information age, people have access to all the essential information they need while travelling. The role of tour operators and related companies has shrunk in many ways. However, the outbreak of COVID-19, as the most severe pandemic in decades, has increased uncertainty for these workers, and hurt their job security.

        Changes in the industry - from the past to COVID era
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="superstrong">Phuriwat Limthavornrat</span> is president of the Association of Domestic Travel and the owner of the tour operator P. Incentive Tour Event company and says there were economic problems from the end of last year. <span class="quote">"Before the pandemic outbreak began, we had an economic problem"</span>, he says. <span class="quote">"People didn't have much money and didn't travel much. Then the government launched a campaign named 'Eat-Shop-Spend' to stimulate tourism in Thailand"</span>.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The figures from Thailand's Ministry of tourism and Sports conform with his explanation. In the third to the fourth quarter of 2019, the number of domestic visitors and the receipts from them are lower than the same period in 2018.
    </div>
    <div class="vis">
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/3899201" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/3899201/embed" aria-label=""><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Phuriwat says the outbreak meant tourism entrepreneurs' hope of a recovery in the high season of 2020 was lost. Tour operators lost all their income under lockdown measures.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"There are no 'big' or 'small' players in the tourism industry anymore because everyone is at the same level"</span>, he adds. <span class="quote">"This kind of situation hadn't happened in decades, and it was a hundred times' worse than the SARS outbreak."</span>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="superstrong">Pornchanok Sakthani</span> found himself in a similar situation. He's the owner of another domestic and out-bound tour operator, Ocean Smile Tour Company Limited. He says no-one in the businesses was prepared for the outbreak. They felt the first period of the pandemic was 'a shock period' and there was nothing they could do except to look for second jobs in food or sales.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="superstrong">Betty Boo</span> has been a Thai tour guide for European tourists. She says that in the past international tourists who visited Thailand often booked a full tour package which included flights, accommodation, city tour, Thai spa and massage, or an evening market tour. However today, tourists tend to book each service separately themselves.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"Our only main role nowadays is to be a guide, and narrate the history of the palaces and temples. The tourists will learn nothing about those places if they visit them by themselves,"</span> Betty says.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Betty still hasn't returned to her job because of the impact from the pandemic. She says the numbers of European tourists, her group of customers, began to decrease in February and one month later, were completely gone. Her experience is in line with Thailand's tourism statistics which indicate that the number of tourists from several countries started to fall significantly in January. 
    </div>
    <div class="vis">
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/3647779" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/3647779/embed" aria-label=""><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        She adds that several embassies ordered their citizens in Thailand at that time, to return to their countries after finishing the tour program, and she did not have any ideas about doing another job, <span class="quote">"I am now over 65 years old. I don't know what things I can do unless to be a merchant or to sell foods, and I can't do it."</span>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        She says that in her company, permanent employees get only 30% of their monthly salary while the company is not making any money. Many employees who cannot accept this rate of pay decided to resign.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        On the entrepreneurs' side, capital -- or a lack of it -- is one of the big problems they have. Phuriwat explains that 70% of tour operators are small and medium enterprises. Many small enterprises don't have enough fund reserved for emergencies. 
    </div> 
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"The tourism business is about making cash flow. You get the money from this group of tourists and use it for the costs of another group"</span> he says. <span class="quote">"So the businesses don't have the funds in reserved. When the tourists are gone, the cash flow disappears immediately. They don't know what direction they should go in if the government doesn't support them"</span>.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        As a business owner, he decided to cut costs by allowing his employees to work from home and continued paying full salary for two months. Then, he informed his employees about the company's financial status and let them resign if they had another job. In the end from 12 employees before the pandemic, he now has only four employees left and has stopped recruiting new employees. He emphasises that most of the tour operators have reduced the number of employees as well, and hundreds of tour operators have closed permanently.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The department of tourism doesn't have historical statistics about the decreasing number of registered tour operators. However, we found the number of registered tour operators on 24 April 2020 in the cabinet resolution document, which was 13,391 operators. Then, the snapshot statistics on 26 August 2020 indicated that the number became 12,353 operators, less than in April at around 8%. Phuriwat added that these numbers still do not include the hundreds of unregistered tour operators which may have closed as well.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"The number of closed companies will grow continuously because the tourism industry hasn't recovered, especially in-bound and out-bound tour operators. These operators will be the group most at risk, while the domestic tour operators may be able to survive,"</span> Phuriwat says.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        None of the people I spoke to believe the tour operator business will recover quickly once lockdown measures are eased. Betty believes her foreign customers will come back to travel in Thailand again in 2021, although not as big groups as they try to maintain social distancing. On the other hand, Phuriwat and Pornchanok believe that it will take longer to see a recovery. Even though Thai people have started to travel in Thailand again, most of the tourists are traveling by themselves without buying tour programs.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"80-90% of domestic tourists who use our service travel as groups, but nowadays that kind of travelling haven't recovered yet"</span>, Phuriwat reveals. <span class="quote">"First, they lack confidence. Second, they still don't want to sit on the same coach or don't want to travel together,"</span>.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Pornchanok says most of the domestic tourists who travel with the tour operators are customers from public sectors, companies, or organisations which want to arrange seminars or field trips for their employees. He thinks it will take longer than two years for this market to recover.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"When companies are collapsing or in a critical state everywhere, how they can spend their money on travel?"</span> he asks.
    </div>
    <div class="subtopic subtopic-4">
        Debt is coming
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Pornchanok says that at this challenging time, the tour operators are like 'hibernating frogs'; they have to use any money they have saved to survive. The more savings they have, the longer they can continue in businesses. Their other choice is to find another source of income from selling other products.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        However, when tour operator owners lack the cash to pay their employees and themselves, borrowing money from loan sharks might be unavoidable, says Phuriwat.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"They've already cut their business cost by decreasing the number of employees, closing their offices, and working from home. But, there are some fixed costs they still have to pay like electricity and internet bills. They don't know where they can get the money from, and their income is zero."</span>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        In Thailand, money from loan sharks comes with very high interest rates and unfair debt collection. However, Phuriwat accepts that the question about their survival is more critical than the debt collection.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"Today they (the entrepreneurs) aren't yet facing the question 'who will collect my debt?', they have only one question 'do I have enough money to eat?'. If they don't have money they will starve,"</span> he says.
    </div>
    <div class="subtopic subtopic-4">
        Less deposit from operators VS More complaints from tourists
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        In March, the government reduced by 70% the money which new operators have to pay as a deposit. This deposit is designed to become compensation if tourists face problems during their trips with the operators. The existing operators could request for 70% of their deposits to be refunded as well. By 7 August 2020, only around 40% of them requested for these refunds, according to the data from Department of Tourism.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        However, a report by the business paper Prachachat Business indicates that although this could increase the cash flow of tour operators in the short term, it will increase the risk of a lack of compensation to pay for tourists in the long term. 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The tourism and sports minister Pipat Ratchakitprakarn insists however that he has a policy to set up a new fund and will use the remaining deposit to protect tourists. He also expects to recall full deposits from operators in the future.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Statistics from Thailand's Office of Consumer Protection indicate that in the first six months of 2020, complaints about tour operators submitted to the office rose dramatically, compared to the same period in 2019. It is worth noting that the main category of complaint is 'Contract cancellation and refunding'.

        Soft loans: difficult when everyone needs to protect their businesses
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The government has also provided soft loans for small and medium enterprises, including tour operators,. However, Phuriwat and Pornchanok believe that there are not many tour operators which can get loans. Pornchanok says that the bank will lend the money to customers with preference given to those with the best credit histories. 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Phuriwat estimates that 70% of tour operators which are SMEs could not get these loans for several reasons. <span class="quote">"Businesses in this industry don't have any collateral. And the banks know that the tourism industry is at risk. So, they won't lend money easily and they set very strict conditions for any loan requests. There is no room for us."</span> 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        This problem still wasn't resolved by August, when Supawan Tanomkieatipume, the president of the Thai hotel association, met the Tourism Authority of Thailand. She revealed that there out of more than 1,000 applications by tourism-related businesses only 390 had had a loan request approved.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Additionally, the debt moratorium measures only help to a certain extent according to Phuriwat. Although people can stop paying the principal, they still have to pay the interest on some of their loans.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        So, why are the banks setting such strict criteria to approve loan requests? <span class="superstrong">Kittipong Rueanthip</span>, Senior Economist at the Krungthai COMPASS research centre in Thailand, says there is a high risk that a lot of debts will become non-performing loans (NPL), the loans which borrowers have not paid the agreed instalments for a specific period, for two reasons. These factors are the more extended period of the COVID-19 outbreak and the slowing down of consumption after the lockdown period because people don't have money, or won't want to spend it. This risk means the banks won't approve loan requests easily.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"If the government thinks that soft loans are so important, the question is can you (the government) carry the burden from NPL instead of the banks? And that is also not the duty of the government,"</span> Kittipong says.
    </div>
    <div class="subtopic subtopic-4">
        A tourism stimulation package: Encouragement or Discouragement?
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The two biggest moves to stimulate the tourism industry in Thailand were approved in June, using money borrowed by the government. One of these campaigns, called 'Encouragement', is aimed at tour operators, and is worth $76.8 million. Through this campaign, the government subsidises tour package charges per person, for 1.2 million frontline workers who are treating COVID-19 patients in small local hospitals all over the country. The tour package charge provided in this campaign is worth $64 per tourist. The tourists have to spend at least two days and a night in the tour programme. The purpose of this project is to support both frontline workers and tour operator businesses and to allows the income to be distributed into related businesses. 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Nonetheless, Phuriwat still has concerns about the effectiveness of this campaign. He says the average age of public health volunteers is 55 years old, which means there will be some volunteers who are too old to travel. And some of them may not have technology or enough technical skills to register on phones or computers.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Another tour operators' concern that's been raised is about the money that the government is spending on this campaign. The $64 provided by the government is 'not enough' in Phuriwat's opinion. He insisted that this amount of money will lead to tour service with bad conditions. For instance, the tourists may have to stay as four persons together in the same hotel room, or they may get only a rice box as a meal instead of going to the restaurant.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        He also declared that some tour operators have already given up in their attempts to join this campaign, because they know that they won't be able to run good, and profitable, tour programmes with for this amount of money. He also says that the entrepreneurs have another burden: finding a massive amount of money to pay in advance before they can claim reimbursement from the government.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"Suppose there are 30 tourists per group and the cost per head is $64, that makes $1,920. They (the entrepreneurs) have to find $1,920 to run their business. When they still have nothing, where can they find this amount of money?"</span> asks the president of the Association of Domestic Travel.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        He adds that if entrepreneurs want to take part in this scheme, they may have to borrow the money from loan sharks. However, he estimates that the entrepreneurs will take only $1.6-$3.2 profit per head of tourist, and this profit is still less than the interests they have to pay back. 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"How this can be an 'encouragement'?"</span>, asks Phuriwat. <span class="quote">"I called this package as 'discouragement', not encouragement. Discouragement for both tourists and service providers."</span>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Phuriwat's view about the profit is in line with that of <span class="superstrong">Kitti Pornsiwakij</span>, the assistant president of the Tourism Council of Thailand, who agrees that tour operators will get a small profit from this package. He also reveals that there were some discussions with the Tourism Authority of Thailand or Thailand's Ministry of Tourism and Sports, about fine-tuning the campaigns. However, there have only been changes to the 'We travel together' campaign, while the 'Encouragement' campaign has not been changed whatsoever.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        On the government side however, one official accepts that the $64 per tourist from the government is not enough. However, he says it's difficult to give any more.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"We're helping as much as we can,"</span> says <span class="superstrong">Watcharaphan Bunnag</span>, the marketing officer at the Tourism Authority of Thailand. <span class="quote">"We cannot extend the scheme because any spending nowadays has both pros and cons. There will be some people who attack us about how we spend the budget. And we have to provide the budget to rehabilitate other sectors in the economic system as well."</span>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Watcharaphan also says that reimbursement after the work has been finished is common practice everywhere, <span class="quote">"In all government sectors, no one will pay you in advance before you finish your jobs."</span>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        In the economist's opinion, Kittipong believes that the tourism stimulation campaigns, including 'Encouragement', will distribute income from domestic tourists into local businesses, even though the amount of revenue from domestic tourists may not compensate for the income from missing foreign tourists.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        On the employees' side, although most of them are not covered by the social security system, they have got benefits from other measures. These include electricity and water bill subsidies, and a special subsidy for freelancers who are not in the social security system. Betty tells us that she got a special subsidy as well.
    </div> 
    <div class="subtopic subtopic-4">
        Other needs from the entrepreneur
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Pornchanok says that he did not want any help from the government while Phuriwat, as president of the Association of Domestic Travel, says entrepreneurs are like 'trees which need water' and that they urgently need the government's help to tide them over. Phuriwat wants more flexible measures such as soft loans with more relaxed criteria, an extension of financial aid from the social security system, and te packages like 'Encouragement' without that aren't restricted to a specific group of customers. He also wants to see campaigns to promote Thailand tourism, especially in the upcoming high season. He says government sectors could play an essential role by seting up seminars using the service of tour operators.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"The government should instruct all of its sectors to run meetings or seminars by using the service of tour operators,"</span> Pornchanok says. <span class="quote">"When they travel, the wheels of the industry will start to roll immediately."</span>
    </div>
    <div class="subtopic subtopic-4">
        Look to the future
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The crisis from the outbreak is also encouraging people in this industry to adapt, even though they do not expect a quick recovery.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Betty and Phuruwat believe that, except for smaller groups of tourists, which are going to be a new trend in tour operator businesses, tour operators should not use price cuts as a strategy to recover.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"If you cut the price, we all will lose. You cut the price, and the profit you get will drop from $10-$16 to only $0.6-$1.6 per tourist -- Why would you do that?"</span> Phuriwat says. He emphasises that business owners should change their approach and focus on customers with high purchasing power. They should offer new types of tour packages to encourage tourists who usually travel abroad to travel at home instead.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Betty insists that the tour package price in Thailand is comparatively low when compared to other countries and that it is difficult to cut the price any further. But she expects to see cooperation between tour operators more than competition. She also thinks that tour operators have to enhance their service to attract customers after the outbreak.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"Every company has to discuss the way to run their businesses, to attract tourists. Then, they can start to compete"</span> says Betty.
    </div>
    <div class="content last-block-content">
        Phuriwat also emphasises that tourists will seek tour operators with high standards. So, he believes, entrepreneurs will have to upskill and reskill themselves and their employees. In addition, he suggests that the entrepreneurs have to make their businesses accessible through online platforms, to serves the customers' new behaviour.
