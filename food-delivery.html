                No matter who you are, food is an essential resource even during a pandemic outbreak. However, the lockdown and commercial flight restrictions in Thailand have inevitably affected the restaurant sector, especially restaurants which depend on foreign visitors. How can they adapt their business to survive? I spoke to the people relate to this sector on the phone to find the answer.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="subtopic subtopic-3">
        When the tourists were no longer there, the restaurants suffered. 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"My restaurant is located on the highway connected to the southern region. In April, which is the tourist season, there should be many buses with tourists, or private cars with families, or vans with foreign tourists having meals at my restaurant. Most of my income is from these groups of tourists,"</span> <span class="superstrong">Punyapat Rushatasakorn</span>, one of Newrosthip Restaurant's management team tells me. This restaurant is in Samut Sakhon Province in the Central region of Thailand.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        He says up to 20% of their restaurant's income comes from local people. <span class="quote">"Another 40-50% comes from tourists, and another remaining part is the income from hiring out our restaurant to hold a seminar, birthday, or marriage celebration,"</span> He adds that when the COVID-19 outbreak started, and the government announced lockdown measures and these events could not be held, that meant the second and third part of the income was gone. 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The severity of this situation means his management team decided to give their employees a temporary furlough. He says that in the first period under lockdown measures, there were only five employees who were still working in his restaurant, from around 40 employees. Then when the lockdown measures were eased, his management team called the employees back to work, but some of these employees decided not to go back.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The story is quite similar to another restaurant in the capital city. <span class="superstrong">Pruet Termpaisit</span>, the owner of 'Here Hai' restaurant, says the disappearance of foreign tourists during the COVID-19 outbreak meant he lost the income both from foreigners and the eat-in service with Thai customers. His restaurant is located in Thonglor road, one of the most famous areas for tourists and foreigners to visit in Bangkok.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        He also explains that normally, foreigners made up 40% of all customers, and the spending rate per head for foreign tourists is generally high.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"The only group of foreign customers who remained during the outbreak was the permanent residents who live in that area. Most of them are Japanese, Koreans, or Chinese. But the number of these customers is not much."</span> says Pruet. He concluded that cumulative revenue decreased around 50%, but the rest of the income still was able to cover all the costs he had.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        However, his employees were not furloughed. Pruet believes that keeping employees with the restaurant is so important. He gave them the same salary rate as it was before the COVID-19 period. Even so, his employees got less overtime pay due to the shorter opening hours, which was the result of the government's curfew order in the nights.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The data from Euromonitor International show that the consumer foodservice market in Thailand was worth $29.2 billion in 2019, or 5.52% of Thailand's GDP that year. The Tourism Authority of Thailand revealed that 89% of tourists ate Thai food during their trips the same year. That matches what some restaurant executives report about missing income from foreigners leaving them struggling at this difficult time.

        Food delivery during the pandemic - a means of survival
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        During the lockdown period, these two restaurants changed their business model to a takeaway service or/and delivery service through food delivery platforms or local riders, like many other restaurants. A survey by Thailand's Electronic Transactions Development Agency (EDTA), conducted around 2 months after first domestic COVID-19 patient in Thailand but before lockdown period, found that 85% of the 376 people who responded to the survey ordered food online. Around one-third of these people order food online due to concerns about the pandemic. Most of them ordered the food from big middleman platforms such as Grab, LINE MAN, Foodpanda, or GET, followed by restaurant-owned platforms and social media.
    </div>
    <div class="vis">
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/3464713" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/3464713/embed" aria-label=""><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

    </div>
    <div class="content">
        But restaurant owners say sales from these two methods only help them to 'survive', not to expand.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"When we moved to 100% delivery service, we found that the sales value didn't change much. The people who ordered the food using delivery service were the same group as before the COVID-19 outbreak began, and other people might cook at home,"</span> says Pruet.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Punyapat's situation was so similar. He tells me that his team felt so stressed in the first period of lockdown, then struggled to move their business to only takeaway and delivery service service for more than two months, from the second half of March to May, <span class="quote">"We joined many platforms like Foodpanda or LINE MAN, and we were charged fees by these companies. Although we survived, we were still operating at a loss. We lost around 80% of our income, and the revenue from takeaway and delivery service could not compensate for all the revenue we lost."</span>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        'Some fee' which Punyapat mentions is known as 'gross profit' or GP. It is the sales share which platforms collect from restaurants, and is how platforms make their money. Some news reports in 2019 and 2020 revealed that platform companies have just started to collect GP after letting restaurants operate on the platforms without any GP for a while. However, there are other sources of revenue. <span class="superstrong">Anantaporn Lapsakkarn</span>, a senior researcher at Kasikornthai Research Centre, explains the sources of income and costs of food delivery businesses. 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"The revenue comes from three main sources--first, the 'delivery fee' which they directly collect from the consumers. Second, the fee they received from the riders, and the last one is the fee collected from the restaurants. Meanwhile, the costs usually come from marketing expenses or discounts for consumers."</span> Anantaporn declares.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        In a typical business model, if the restaurants decide to pay GP, the delivery fee may be a small amount or even zero. So, it looks like the customers pay less because they do not have to pay a high delivery fee. However, most restaurants have already included GP into their food prices. So in the end customers also often pay more than usual. Punyapat and Pruet accept this fact as well.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"Yes, all restaurants do the same thing."</span> Punyapat says. Pruet accepts that including GP in food prices has increased the price of all menus in his restaurants. He has changed to using local motorcycle riders to deliver the food instead of the riders from these platforms. Although the sales from this approach are still less than through the platforms.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Using local motorcycle riders may be an alternative to delivery services. However, some restaurants also have other strategies to deal with platform companies. <span class="superstrong">Wisawa Tiyamanee</span>, the owner of 'Rard-Nar Paramount' restaurant in Bangkok, reveals that he did not want to be under the control of the platforms. So, he refused to pay GP for most of the platforms except one which had negotiated with him for a long time to get a deal. 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"For some platforms, I refuse to register with them many times because they want to collect GP from me of around 30%. However, they finally allow customers to order food from my restaurants on their platforms by collecting the delivery fee from customers instead. So, it just was about bargaining power."</span> says Wisawa.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Anantaporn also analyses the reason why restaurants say food deliveries only allow their businesses to survive during this challenging time. He explains that the restaurants' profit does not only come from main dishes, but also from desserts, beverages, or even the service charge. Sometimes the profit from drinks or service charges is much higher than from the main dishes. However, using delivery services can mean the restaurants lose their beverage orders and service charge. This can lead to a massive loss in revenue.
    </div>
    <div class="subtopic subtopic-3">
        The drivers: a difficult time with an uncertain income
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The restaurant owners are not the only ones who have struggled. Delivery drivers also face difficulties. The increased food delivery orders did not necessarily mean everything got better for them.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"There was a huge increase in the number of orders, but the number of riders also increased because of the higher number of unemployed people in that period"</span>, says <span class="superstrong">Pornpon Thanasuwannatarn</span>, a former rider with Grab food delivery service in Nonthaburi, a province besides Bangkok in the central region of Thailand. <span class="quote">"The delivery tasks I did during COVID-19 period turned out to be very low"</span>. He was a driver for a short period before he gave his rider account to his younger brother, but he still has heard the problems his brother faces.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"Suppose you do your work from 9 am to 8 pm, you will normally get at least 5-6 delivery tasks per day or equal $26-$32 of income. However, when the outbreak happened, sometimes I got only one task per day with the income only at a little more than $1"</span> Pornpon explains. 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        He adds that firstly he wondered if the low number of tasks per day might be connected to the area he worked, so he decided to enter the Siam and Pathumwan areas in the centre of Bangkok. Then he found on the mobile application for riders that those areas which used to be 'the red zone', or the zone where the number of orders was higher than the number of riders, had changed into a "normal" zone.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"In that time, I saw a lot of riders from Grab, Foodpanda, and other platforms were waiting for the delivery jobs. I waited there all day, and I got no job."</span> He adds.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        He also says that some riders might not have enough money to buy the official rider's bag or uniform from the company at this time. He wants the company to loosen the rules about wearing only the official uniform or take on the cost for some riders who could not afford it.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Some of Pornpon's issues were similar to another area in Thailand. <span class="superstrong">Mick</span> (not the real name), a rider with another food delivery platform in a northern province, reveals that his company accepted everyone who applied to be a rider during lockdown. So, the increased revenue was shared between more riders. In his area, the company also reduced the income each rider got per task by around 5-7% and increased the rate of GP it collected from restaurants by around 2%.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        However, his situation was still better than Pornpon's because he still got a higher number of tasks per day than usual. He accepts that he is still doing this job because it provides him with the flexibility to work, and his average cumulative revenue per month is still higher than for full-time employees in other companies in his hometown.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"Now I get a monthly revenue of around $800, and I feel that it is more difficult to find another job in the same area with the monthly salary just only $480. Although I made less money per job, the number of jobs increased significantly."</span> says Mick. He also believes that the company will make greater profit due to the increased number of food delivery orders. He does not understand why the company decided to cut the rate of income per task.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"This is the issue that I and every rider feel disappointed about, but what could I do? It is the outbreak period. If we protest, the company will fire us. So, we have to accept it."</span> Mick adds.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The increased number of food delivery orders and riders mentioned by these two riders is in line with the data from LINE MAN and Grab, two big food delivery platforms. <span class="superstrong">Phichet Rerkpreecha</span>, the CEO of LINE (Thailand) revealed in July that the number of active LINE MAN users grew by 300% during the lockdown period. While data from Grab released in May indicated that most of its riders (and drivers in case of Taxi or Car services) joined its platform in the previous six months.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Both riders reveal that some incentives they got as extra income separate from their normal revenue, have decreased or vanished. For example, there was a bonus they got when accepting a delivery task in an area without many riders, and a reward for the rider who never turned down any jobs. This is in line with Grab's announcement in July that the drivers' incentive would be reduced soon in 27 provinces of Thailand. They also indicate that the famous brand restaurants have an advantage over the regular street food restaurants or stalls due to their potential to create some attractive promotions. So, many small food businesses opened during the pandemic had to close because they cannot compete.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Pornpon, who opened his own home kitchen business during this lockdown period as well, gives me an example about this situation. He mentions the 'buy one get one free' promotion of the big Sukiyaki restaurant in Thailand, to sell their roasted duck on rice for almost $3: <span class="quote">"This restaurant was charged 30% of that price by the food delivery platforms, so they got only $2 for two dishes of this menu. If you're a no-name restaurant and you sell this menu for $2, how can you compete with the big restaurants? Because you have to spare 30% from your price to be charged by the delivery platforms as well."</span> 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        He concludes that this mechanism 'was just under the control of capitalism'. Mick also adds that some food delivery platforms also subsidise lost income for some famous brand restaurants.
    </div>
    <div class="subtopic subtopic-3">
        The platform: growing while losing money 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Food delivery platforms also thought they suffered during the lockdown. <span class="superstrong">Taweesup Tiyawongmana</span>, a City Expansion Lead at Grab Thailand, one of the food delivery platform operators in Thailand, accepts that Grab saw extraordinary growth in its food delivery business during the lockdown period. However, because this business regularly makes a loss, a higher number of transactions means greater losses overall. 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        He adds that Grab accept the loss because it is a way to increase its market share to be sizable, which will turn its food business into profit in the future.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"Our transport business, the taxi or car, is a profitable business, but food (delivery) is a loss-making business. If the food business grows, that means heavier losses and not only the impact from the food side. We also saw a downturn in our transport business as well,"</span> Taweesup declares. He adds that the sales value of Grab's transportation business fell by around 90% in tourist areas. The company allowed its car drivers who had lost income to deliver food on a long-distance route or on a trip with a large amount of food instead.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Taweesup explains that the lockdown also forced the people who usually don't have a meal at home to learn about food delivery services. But he says it's hard to estimate the growth rate under lockdown measures.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"In the first phase of lockdown, everyone was shocked. They said 'Argh... I'm too panicked to do anything.' and they ordered food, ordered, and ordered,"</span> He says, <span class="quote">"In that period sales were boosted by around 30% week-on-week in the cities where our business was matured. Then, it seemed like the people tried to adapt their lives because they started thinking that the lockdown period might be a long time."</span>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Taweesup says the number of new restaurants or food stalls which registered with Grab each week roughly doubled (when compared to the normal situation) for around two months before returning to the usual rate again. 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Taweesup emphasises that the food delivery business in Thailand is still not a sustainable. He says the companies pay drivers' income higher than the appropriate level, and the customers still pay a lower price than they should. However, he thinks COVID-19 has been a 'catalyst' which will ultimately help the platforms.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"That means nothing will return to normal. It seems like COVID-19 has left some traces, like 'because of COVID, so these things happened'. The ways people spend their money are not the same. The restaurant business is not the same as well. Some restaurants never wanted to join Grab until the outbreak started, and when the outbreak ends, they will still be with us."</span> says Taweesup. 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        He also believes that people have been educated about the food delivery service, and the people who know about this service are not only middle- or high-income people, or only the tech-savvy anymore. 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"The time it takes to make our business profitable should be shorter due to the pandemic, but it was obstructed by the things we help the society."</span> He adds that his company could increase the GP rate, but it wouldn't because of concerns about the difficulties that the restaurants which join its platform, or its driver faced.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Nevertheless, before the interview with Taweesup in June, Grab faced controversy in April over its policy to increase the GP rate for new registered restaurants and stalls, delivery fee, and small order fee. After an overwhelming amount of criticism, Grab decided to cancel the GP rate and delivery fee increase. <span class="superstrong">Tarin Thaniyavarn</span>, Grab's CEO in that time explained in April that the decision to increase GP rate happened due to the needs to decrease overwhelm demand of restaurants and stalls. He claimed that the number of restaurants and stalls which wanted to register with its platform had raised from 400-500 to 1,500-2,000 restaurants or stalls per day. That made its staff could not handle the registration process efficiently. 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Then on August 10th, hundreds of Grab riders protested in front of Grab Thailand's head office. They called for solutions to their problems, such as the rule which forces them to buy jackets and bags from the company, and insurance. Grab then promised to consider riders' demand within seven days. After seven days passed, the company released its statement to clarify about these issues, followed by arrange a meeting between Grab and the riders' representatives. The riders' representatives posted on their Facebook page after the meetings that most of the issues were resolved to an extent. They encouraged all riders to 'wait and see' the progress of solving these issues in a long term.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        We got no response to our request for an interview from other delivery platforms in Thailand, which are LINE MAN, Foodpanda, and GET (which has been renamed to Gojek). However, Taweesup says that most of the food delivery platforms in Thailand still make a loss, except the platforms which collect expensive delivery fees. Anantaporn believes in the same way.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"We, as the consumers, normally select the food delivery application we will use from the final price. If we see the lowest price or the best discount on an app, we will use that app. So, it's not surprising that the costs of food delivery businesses will expand a lot,"</span> says Anantaporn. 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        From the official statistics by Thailand's Department of Business Development, Foodpanda suffered greater losses every year from 2017 to the latest data in 2019. Other platform owners suffered losses as well, but these platforms also include other services such as taxis or messengers.
    </div>
    <div class="subtopic subtopic-3">
        Although some players may be defeated, the attractive factor is 'data'
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The analysis published by Kasikornthai Research Centre in Thailand estimates that in the first six months of 2020, the number of food delivery transactions grew by around 150%, compared to the same period in 2019. In comparison, the second half will see a growth rate of about 17% if there isn't a second wave of the outbreak. This has made the number of transactions for the year overall increase by around 80%. In the next few years, the number of food delivery transactions will be lower than in 2020 but higher than in 2019 by approximately 4-7%. Anantaporn believes that the price will still be a factor in this industry because consumers are familiar with the current price. However, the platforms which want to turn a profit from their businesses may look for new ways to generate revenue.
    </div>
    <div class="vis">
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/3470843" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/3470843/embed" aria-label=""><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"In the future, they may set up promotions only at some periods, because in the past the new competitors like to set up promotions for a very long period. They may increase the commission fee rate, or decrease the benefits they used to give, or find other revenue sources such as the backend service,"</span> says Anantaporn. He adds that for fine dining or user experience-based restaurants, people will still go to restaurants. In contrast, people will use food delivery services more with particular kinds of food and beverage. That means consumer behaviour may still be liable to change.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        His analysis also indicates that there are new competitors who are coming to the industry with new business models. An example is the model with no fee collected from the restaurants, quicker revenue paid to the restaurants, or even more useful mobile applications. However, when there are new competitors, but some of the current players still cannot make a profit, this may lead to some players having to withdraw from the industry or being merged with other companies.
