                The number of tourist arrivals around the world in the first half of 2020 has dropped 65% from the
                previous year according to the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), after international travel almost
                vanished because of the Coronavirus pandemic. This is part of the 2020 economic loss that is three times
                that of the global economic crisis that began in 2007. A country which has necessarily been affected by
                this calamity is Thailand, where the tourism industry is one of the most important sectors of the

            However, when the COVID-19 outbreak began, I had no job for 3 months. My company may be out of business now
            I think."</span> says <span class="superstrong">Pornpon Thanasuwannatarn</span> who lost his job during the
        pandemic period, and then became a food delivery driver and restaurant owner to earn a living.

    <div class="content">
        He adds that the sign of danger appeared during Chinese New Year period, or around last week of January,
        <span class="quote">"From that time, many tour guides started to talk or post on their Facebook profile, asked
            that what should they do if the lockdown period would come. Some of them started selling foods, returning to

        His income fell from at least $160 per week to only $32-$64 per month. He tells us that his savings are running

    </div>
    <div class="content">
        His story is just one of many in this difficult time. There are also other opinions from the people in the
        tourism industry in this article, which I interviewed them on the phone.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        In the big picture, Thailand is popular among tourists around the world because of its beautiful nature,
        cultural attractions, and the famous Thai food. In 2019, the receipt from international and Thai visitors was
        around $96 billion, or 17.83% of Thailand's gross domestic product in 2019.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="superstrong">Kittipong Rueanthip</span>, Senior Economist at Krungthai COMPASS research centre in
        Thailand, says the importance of
        tourism in Thailand has increased dramatically in the last 10-20 years. <span class="quote">"At the starting of
            the 2000s, it was around 3-6%. However, if we look just only receipts from international tourists nowadays,
            it is around 10% of GDP, so it has increased a lot."</span>

        <span class="quote">"There are more than three million employees who work in tourism-related sectors, from 40

        Kittipong adds.

        Tourism receipts dropped dramatically, with difficult recovery
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The COVID-19 pandemic has damaged all sectors of Thailand's economic system, including tourism. The warning
        signs started when China, the biggest source of international tourists for Thailand, suffered from an outbreak
        in the last months of 2019. This was followed by the announcement to ban Chinese people from booking overseas
        tours in January 2020. The number of foreign visitors fell from that month on and hit zero in April, with a ban
        on commercial flights and the borders closed as part of a state of emergency. Meanwhile, the number of Thai
        visitors fell dramatically as well. (The term 'visitors' includes both tourists and excursionists)
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        This means the income from these visitors vanished. Total receipts from all visitors in the first nine months of
        2020 fell to less than half of what they were in the same period of 2019.
    </div>
    <div class="vis">
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy" data-src="visualisation/3290858"

        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        It seems like the tourism sectors in Thailand are now in a recovery period nowadays. There had been only a few
        new domestic infected people in these recent months, and lockdown measures were eased to a point at which
        everything is almost back to normal.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Nevertheless, people in the tourism industry don't expect a quick recovery.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"Our forecast indicates that receipts from Thai tourists this year will be $20.80 billion,
            falling from $34.56 billion in the previous year,"</span> says <span class="superstrong">Kitti
            Pornsivakij</span>, the assistant president of the Tourism Council of Thailand, as a representative of the
        tourism-related private sector. <span class="quote">"As far as I heard from the entrepreneurs, the door is now
            closed for the hope to gain the number of foreign tourists in this year."</span>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The Tourism Council of Thailand also predicts that the revenue from foreign tourists will be only $19.52
        billion, down from the previous goal of $64 billion. That means total receipts from tourism in 2020 will be only
        41% of what they were in 2019.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Meanwhile, the public sector expects a little less revenue than the forecast of the private sector.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"We forecasted that it will recover to around 30%, both in terms of the number of domestic
            tourists and the receipts from them"</span>, says <span class="superstrong">Watcharaphan Bunnag</span>, the
        marketing officer at the Tourism Authority of Thailand, <span class="quote">"We expect that the number of
            international tourists will recover to not more than 10%."</span> He believes social distancing
        measures will decrease the capacity of transportation systems and increase the cost. Travellers who cannot
        afford to pay this higher fee will change their destination to other routes to save money.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The ban on international commercial flights to Thailand is another critical factor in Watcharaphan's analysis.
        There will be a limited number of foreigners allowed to enter the country for specific reasons, such as business
        travellers. Even though he believes that international commercial flights will be allowed to land again from
        October, he also thinks that there will be only some foreign countries in which their citizens will be allowed.
        The Thai government will accept only the citizens from the countries where the outbreak situations are safe
        enough. The concept of 'Travel Bubble', or the agreement which one destination country will permit travellers
        from certain selected countries to enter its area, may be introduced as well. He also adds that although the
        international flight arrivals will be allowed, the travellers will be only the people who have a demonstrated
        need to travel.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"They will not be the people who say 'Yeah... let's go to Paris!', or 'Hey, I wanna go to
            the
            USA tomorrow'"</span>, Watcharaphan maintains, <span class="quote">"They will rethink again about the
            severity of the outbreak in their destination areas. In the past, when we traveled, we use our hearts more
            than our brains. But from now on, we have to use our brains before our hearts."</span>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        His prediction is quite similar to the latest government's response in September. The Thai government decided to
        allow international tourists to enter the country under special types of visa called 'Special Tourist Visa',
        aimed to attract long-stay tourists. These tourists will be permitted to stay in Thailand for 90 days, but this
        period can be extended up to not more than 270 days. Some of foreigners in other groups such as investors,
        businesspeople, people who have work permits, teachers, and students are allowed to enter the country as well.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        In the longer-term, Kitti says domestic tourism in 2021 will rebound to nearly the same level as 2019. The
        revenue from domestic tourists is expected to reach $28.8 billion. At the same time, the numbers of
        international tourists will depend on the progress to find an effective vaccine for the new coronavirus. If the
        vaccine can be found in the first quarter of 2021, the number of foreign tourists in the next year may reach 30
        million people or equals $48 billion receipt.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"Nevertheless, as some experts expected, if we find the vaccine in the third quarter, the
            number of foreign tourists will only be 20 million people and income will be only $32 billion or half of the
            income we got in 2019."</span> Kitti explains.

        It's also a tragedy for the businesses
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        All related businesses have been affected in this challenging time, to varying degrees. A survey from the
        Tourism Council of Thailand revealed that entertainment venues were completely shut down, followed by spa and
        sightseeing businesses which were almost all closed (98% and 91% respectively). Overall, 65% of all
        tourism-related business was temporarily shut down. That means the same percentage of employees in these
        businesses, or about 2.6 million people, were temporarily unemployed. The survey results also revealed that 8%
        of employers in tourism-related businesses plan to dismiss their employees in the third quarter of 2020, while
        another 30% are hesitating about employee dismissal.

        Meanwhile, the official figures for unemployed people who had ever worked from the office of national statistics
        have been released as well. The only group of industries in these figures which can be directly connected to
        tourism is 'Accommodation and Food Service'. The number of unemployed persons who had ever worked in this
        industry group shockingly increased more than four times from the first to the second quarter of 2020. We also
        found that the benefits of many employees, such as overtime, food, and other income have gone.

    <div class="content">
        Kittipong explains that laying off employees in these sectors at this time may increase the level of
        inequalities because the employees may not regularly receive high income. Meanwhile, the entrepreneurs have been
        affected as well because the hotel or restaurant businesses are not 'high-margin' businesses because of high
        competition. This may lead to a cash flow problem, and the companies can be collapsed easily.

        Different opinions about the support:<br />Entrepreneurs' demand VS Economist's concern
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The Thai government has launched several measures to support entrepreneurs at this challenging time. These
        include soft loans, loan repayment holidays, and deferral of tax payments. Meanwhile, the social security fund
        will pay benefits for employees who are covered and who were dismissed, temporarily laid off, or who resigned.
        If employees are not covered by the social security fund, they can request a particular benefit from the
        government. A survey result from The Tourism Council of Thailand has revealed that 86% of business
        owners and employees in tourism-related businesses received help from government measures.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        However, the council has raised concerns about uncertainties in the labour market. Many business owners still
        have not decided if they will lay off their employees, so the council has asked the government to extend the
        period of supportive measures. For example, extending the loan payment holiday until the end of 2020, or making
        the criteria for soft loans approval more flexible so more businesses can take advantage of them. Kitti reveals
        that the private sector is negotiating with the Bank of Thailand about these criteria. He also proposes that the
        government should set up other funds with more specific purposes to support tourism-related businesses. The
        funds can provide loans which are easy to access or provide grants to improve tourism marketing and employees'
        skills.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        In June, the cabinet approved two main packages, worth three-quarters of a billion dollars, to stimulate
        domestic tourism. The first package ('We travel together') was designed to subsidise accommodation fees,
        transportation fees, and other travelling expense for Thai travellers. It also helped accommodation owners,
        transportation operators and other entrepreneurs such as restaurant or tourist attraction owners. Another
        package ('Encouragement') was designed to subsidise the tour service fee for public health volunteers in small
        local hospitals all over the country. The government hopes that this package will encourage these volunteers and
        help travel agency businesses to survive.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Kitti, as a representative of the private sector in the tourism industry, says he is quite pleased with all of
        these packages. However, the only thing he feels disappointed with is the size of the budget the government
        provided for each package.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Kittipong believes that these two main packages will 'keep businesses alive' because the budget in these
        packages is only part of a government loan. This loan, which is worth $12.8 billion and which was set up for
        social and economic rehabilitation, represents only 5-6% of GDP. He believes that it cannot compensate for the
        lost income from the decreasing number of foreign tourists. Nevertheless, he still thinks the measures will
        stimulate the local economy to some extent, along with other fiscal policies such as particular benefits for the
        employees.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        However, he is concerned about using the budget in tourism rehabilitation. He emphasises that every business has
        to face some risks, and the government has to consider the taxpayer when it wants to spend. He adds that the
        people will lose confidence in the government if tax is used to subsidise businesses which then make profits
        that stay in the hands of the business owners.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"The government should do those things the private sectors cannot do. For example, if you
            are worried about an
            economic crisis, or that the unemployment rate will increase because the hotel businesses is collapsing, you
            can
            provide them with soft loans or debt repayment suspensions"</span> says Kittipong.

    <div class="subtopic subtopic-1">
        Domestic tourism is a key
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        All of the interviewees agree that in this difficult time when numbers of international tourists in Thailand
        will remain lower than usual, domestic tourism is key to fostering the tourism industry. However, tourism
        promotion varies from one part of the country to the next. Watcharaphan suggests that every city should be
        promoted if they have potential by using only their own strengths. He insists that some cities may not be able
        to give tourists or customers everything.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"For example, when you talk about Phuket, it has a lot of potential in things like
            recreation, entertainment, or even meetings. But, if we talk about Krabi, the province is not really a
            meeting area."</span> Watcharaphan explains. Kitti agrees that there are many destinations which are quite
        hard to help because they were designed to support foreign tourists more than Thai tourists.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        However, Kitti believes that Thai travellers will play an important role to supporting tourism in the
        'second-tier provinces', where the number of tourists is still low. The proportion of receipts from tourists
        supports this opinion. There are 66 out of 77 provinces in Thailand which made more money from Thai tourists
        than from foreign tourists in the first four months of 2019. This pattern is still the same in 2020, and 52 from
        these 66 provinces are second-tier provinces.

        Like Kitti, Kittipong believes the areas where Thai tourists predominate will see a quicker recovery: the famous

    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"If the number of tourists who visit those areas is close to the number before the outbreak
            period, their revenue might fall to some extent, but they still have the cash flow to operate their
            businesses. Hence, those areas will see a quicker recovery."</span> says Kittipong.

        Apple Maps which
        revealed the change in driving route requests in
        each Thailand province. This data indicates that the number of driving route requests in provinces where Thai
        tourists predominate is sometimes higher than in the period before COVID-19. This suggests the tourism industry
        in those areas is going to recover.

        Some examples of these provinces are Nakhon Nayok, Petchaburi, and Samut Songkram. It's worth noting that these
        provinces have famous tourist attractions, or are close to Bangkok. While the areas which are far from Bangkok
        and have a higher proportion of foreign tourists, such as Chiang Mai, Mae Hong Son, and Phuket, tend to see low
        numbers of direction requests. This is in line with his analysis, which indicates that people are going to
        travel shorter distances because the economic situation is still delicate.

        On the other hand, Watcharaphan also mentions MICE (Meetings, Incentive Travel, Conventions, and Exhibitions)
        businesses. He says the MICE sector is another interesting choice which the public sector can use to support
        domestic tourism. In 2019, the domestic MICE industry generated $3.4 billion in revenue.

        For international tourists, Kitti believes Thailand will have a greater proportion of tourists from East Asian
        countries such as China, Japan and South Korea as people opt to travel shorter distances. He expects more
        exciting tourism products and in-depth customer segmentation, which will lead to better marketing.

        For him, Thailand should attract more tourists from other countries besides China, to reduce the risk when
        Chinese tourists are not able to travel or do not want to travel. However, Watcharaphan believes this is not the
        right time to promote Thailand's tourism very aggressively as the COVID-19 outbreak, continues in many
        countries.
