                COVID-19 has devastated Thailand's tourism,<br />and recovery is still uncertain.

            <div class="sub-headline">
                The number of tourist arrivals around the world has dropped 56% per cent according to the World Tourism
                Organization (UNWTO), after international travel almost vanished because of the Coronavirus pandemic.
                This is part of the 2020 economic loss that is three times that of the global economic crisis that began
                in 2007. A country which has necessarily been affected by this calamity is Thailand, where the tourism
                industry is one of the most important sectors of the economy. Businesses and people in this industry are
                suffering.

        <span class="quote">"I was a photographer for a tourism guide company, and I used to travel in a lot of
            provinces in Thailand. However, when the COVID-19 outbreak began, I had no job for 3 months. My company may
            be out of business now I think."</span> says <span class="superstrong">Pornpon Thanasuwannatarn</span> who
        lost his job during the pandemic period, and then became a food delivery driver and restaurant owner to earn a

        He adds that the sign of danger appeared during Chinese New Year period, or around last week of January,
        <span class="quote">"From that time, many tour guides started to talk or post on their Facebook profile, asked
            that what should they do if the lockdown period would come. Some of them started selling foods, returning to
            their hometowns, or change their careers permanently."</span>

        His income fell from at least $160 per week to only $32-64 per month. He tells us that his savings are running
        out, and he is going to sell goods at the market from August.

    <div class="content">
        His story is just one of many in this difficult time. There are also other opinions from the people in the
        tourism industry in this article, which I interviewed them on the phone.

    <div class="content">
        In the big picture, Thailand is popular among tourists around the world because of its beautiful nature,
        cultural attractions, and the famous Thai food. In 2019, the receipt from international and Thai visitors was
        around $96 billion, or 17.83% of Thailand's gross domestic product in 2019.

    <div class="content">
        Kittipong Rueanthip, Senior Economist at Krungthai COMPASS research centre in Thailand, says the importance of
        tourism in Thailand has increased dramatically in the last 10-20 years. <span class="quote">â€œAt the starting of
            the 2000s, it was around 3-6%. However, if we look just only receipts from international tourists nowadays,
            it is around 10% of GDP, so it has increased a lot."</span>

        Tourism receipts dropped dramatically, with difficult recovery
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The COVID-19 pandemic has damaged all sectors of Thailand's economic system, including tourism. The warning
        signs started when China, the biggest source of international tourists for Thailand, suffered from an outbreak
        in the last months of 2019. This was followed by the announcement to ban Chinese people from booking overseas
        tours in January 2020. The number of foreign visitors fell from that month on and hit zero in April, with a ban
        on commercial flights and the borders closed as part of a state of emergency. Meanwhile, the number of Thai
        visitors fell dramatically as well.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        This means the income from tourists vanished. Total receipts from all visitors in the first four months of 2020
        fell to only half of what they were in the same period of 2019.

        It seems like the tourism sectors in Thailand are now in a recovery period nowadays. There had been only a few
        new domestic infected people in these recent months, and lockdown measures were eased to a point at which
        everything is almost back to normal.
