                'Pilot' is a dream job for many Thai youngsters because of various reasons such as their passion about
                aviation, the travel, or good income. This means the pilot selection processes of commercial airlines
                and aviation schools in Thailand are quite competitive. But that was before the pandemic. Today,
                COVID-19 has affected pilots' working lives and has changed the situation in the pilot labour market in
                Thailand.

    <div class="content">
        <span class="superstrong">Tom</span> and <span class="superstrong">Pete</span> (not their real name), two
        pilots, have to spend most of their time on the ground these days instead of the planes. Tom has flown less than
        10% of his normal flying time in June and Pete has suffered from his decreased salary and other allowances due
        to less flights he worked, and the measure to force the employees to take leave without pay 5-7 days per month.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Their case are just examples -- I talked with pilots and a pilot student about the turn of their lives during
        this challenging period. All interviews were conducted on the phone in June, when international commercial
        flight arrivals were still restricted by the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT). They share several
        interesting stories with me, but do not want to disclose their real names because they're worried about their
        jobs.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">'It's not a golden time for this career'</span> - this is the opinion of all of them.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"The impact is so severe,"</span> Tom starts telling me. He explains the situation when all
        of the flights in Thailand and other countries were suspended in April. This situation affected all
        aviation-related sectors and made the pilots and the crew didn't have the flights to fly. Some domestic flights
        were allowed in a month later, but the number of flights was so small and the social distancing rules were
        enforced on the airplane. The working hours of pilots were decreased, and the other types of allowance, which is
        separated from normal salary and depends on the number of flights they worked for, were gone.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"These led to the excessive pilot problem, and as we can see, many airlines decided to
            abolish some of their fleets, return the airplane to the parent company abroad. Then, what happens next?
            Laying off the employees including pilots."</span> He adds.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Pete, who works with a low-cost airline in Thailand, tells me what he's been doing during the pandemic. <span
            class="quote">"Most of my time now? Spent with sleeping and reading the books I bought a long time ago
            (laugh). That made me feel a little bit guilty when I saw my colleagues finding different jobs at this
            challenging time."</span>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        He also suspects his company has a plan to lay off pilots because of pressure from the parent company in another
        country.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <a
            href="https://www.iata.org/en/about/worldwide/asia_pacific/digest/covid-19-impact-on-asia-pacific-aviation-worsens/" target="_blank">The
            estimate</a> in April by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) indicated that Thailand will
        lose
        just over eight billion dollars in revenue after losing more than a half of passengers compared to last year.
        The crisis has also put two million aviation-related jobs in Thailand at risk.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"In the big picture of this industry, it's bad now. Student pilots who want to enter the
            industry are facing a difficult time as well. The people who have their jobs in this industry are worried
            that their salary may be cut, or they may be laid off."</span> says <span class="superstrong">Sanong
            Mingcharoen</span>, a pilot captain at Thai Airways and president of the Pilot Association of Thailand.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        By early August, more than 300,000 flights had been cancelled from 532,685 flights which had requested airport
        time slots during the summer in seven of Thailand's major international airports. The number of cancelled
        domestic flights tends to decrease significantly since June due to the improved outbreak situation in the
        country. However, most of the international flights in August and previous months remained cancelled. More
        international flights in September and October could be cancelled if the restrictions are not lifted.

    <div class="content">
        While the pilots think this is a tough time for them, the situation for student pilots, or even the people
        who've applied to be student pilots on some airlines, is worse.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="superstrong">Mark</span> (not his real name), a pilot trainee in an airline, has already finished
        his study in aviation school but he is still under control by the aviation student department. He should have
        been promoted to first officer (or co-pilot) in June or July, but the outbreak meant his promotion was
        postponed.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        He says that the company has invested a huge amount of money in the scholarship it provided to him, so he
        believes the airline will not lay him off. However, he believes he might be the last or almost the last to be
        called when the company brings employees back to work.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"The worst case may be that the company will force me to leave without pay."</span> says
        Mark. <span class="quote">"I feel so lifeless. Now I'm studying for another undergraduate degree in accounting
            to work for my family business. At first, I didn't want to concentrate on this study, but now I have to
            study seriously. If I lose my job, it will be so terrible."</span> He also explains that even though the
        number of cargo flights increased in recent months, the airline only calls the pilots with instructor licenses
        back to work, not the trainees.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"My base salary was cut by around 25%, but in fact, the biggest parts of my income are the
            other types of allowance, which depend on the number of flights I worked."</span> says Mark. He believes he
        lost 60-70% of his income. <span class="quote">"I was a little bit lucky because I was in the stage that I am
            able to and used to fly with my instructor in the real commercial flights. Nevertheless, there is a group of
            students who studied in the aviation school after me. They were going to start flying, but they
            can't."</span>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Tom explains the situation of student pilots in his company to me as well.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"In my company, the student pilot selection process has been cancelled. Meanwhile, the
            training process of the students who were selected previously has been halted as well, and the students who
            were going to start their training are facing big problems because they already resigned from their old jobs
            but they haven't signed a contract with the company yet. It's possible that they have nowhere to work
            now"</span> says Tom.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        In the business side, shocking moments have arrived since late May when Thai Airways, the national airline of
        Thailand and the biggest player in international routes among all Thai airlines, <a
            href="https://www.set.or.th/dat/news/202005/20063375.pdf" target="_blank">filed a request</a> with the
        Central Bankruptcy Court to reorganise its business operations. Thai Airways is well-known about its internal
        management problems and its continuous bad business performance for a long time. It has run at a loss since
        2017, and its latest financial statement in the second quarter of 2020 indicates that it has a negative
        shareholders' equity at -$583.29 million. After that filing, Ministry of Finance sold 3.17% from 51.03% of all
        Thai Airways shares it holds, made the Thai Airways lost its status as a state enterprise. The court granted
        Thai Airways' business reorganization petition in mid-September.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        By the law, during the business reorganising process, the company is still able to run their businesses as usual
        and enters the 'automatic stay' period which provides benefits to the debtors. For example, preventing creditors
        to force a debtor to settle the debt, preventing creditors to file a bankruptcy action or a civil action against
        the debtor, and preventing the public utilities supplied to the debtor such as electricity and water supply,
        from being suspended. But the debtor must not make some actions which will affect the debts such as disposal,
        distribution or transfer, grant a lease, make repayment of debt, or even create debts. The debtor also has to
        prepare the reorganisation plan which must be accepted by the creditors, and then must be approved by the court.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Then in late June NokScoot, a Thai airline with the seventh biggest market share in international routes among
        Thai airlines, <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/nokscoot/photos/a.349234611906087/1582723228557213/" target="_blank">announced</a> it was
        closing down. The company blamed 'difficulties in growing the network and a very
        intense competition environment'. The outbreak of COVID-19 has seen more challenges emerge and has aggravated
        the situation.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        NokScoot also revealed that its 425 employees had been laid off.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        And just one month later NokAir, a Thai airline with the second biggest market share on domestic routes, <a href="https://www.set.or.th/dat/news/202007/20084534.pdf" target="_blank">
        filed a request</a> with the Central Bankruptcy Court to reorganise its business operations as well. NokAir's petition
        indicated that NokAir had $848 million debt, and said that reorganising business operations was the best way to
        solve the company's temporary liquidity problem. The court approved that petition on the same day.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        However, warning signals for the industry have been around since well before the outbreak of COVID-19. Sanong
        says that the industry was over-saturated, but the people didn't know about this and still sent their children
        to study in the aviation schools. There is no new pilot hiring both in the last year and this year.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"There are new 300-500 pilot graduates per year who don't belong to any companies during
            their study. I, as a president of the pilot association, provided the opportunity to these graduates to
            register with us. In the last year, I founded that there were 512 pilots who were unemployed and
            registered,"</span> says Sanong.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        He also explains that there were around 200 pilots who were laid off in 2019 from several airlines. Most of
        them, around 150, have been laid off from 'New Gen Airline' which ceased all operations in October 2019. Other
        50 pilots were from NokAir, NokScoot, and Thai Lion Air.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Sanong adds that lack of diversity in the types of pilots' job in Thailand also made most of the graduates from
        aviation schools want to get a job in the commercial airlines, but these airlines still suffered loss.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"When the competition between commercial airlines became more and more aggressive, they
            competed until they got lower and lower profit. Finally, they announced that they suffered loss. Then when
            outbreak of COVID-19 has begun, the situation has been worsened,"</span> Sanong declares.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Data from Airports of Thailand PCL shows a slowdown in the growth of passengers numbers in six major airports
        in Thailand since 2015. Most airline companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand have suffered losses in
        recent years. Even Bangkok Airways which still made profit last year also saw decreased profit.

        Pete says the aviation industry had been affected before the pandemic period due to two main factors: economic
        growth slowdown, and the number of Chinese visitors which fell after the boat disaster in Thailand's Phuket
        province in 2018. 47 Chinese tourists died in the sinking, and Thailand's handling was <a
            href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/11/asia/china-thailand-boat-accident-intl/index.html" target="_blank">poorly
            received</a> in China.
        This was compounded by the explanation of Kitti Siwapornkij, the assistant president of the Tourism Council of
        Thailand, who says the tragedy cost Thailand 'several hundred billion baht' in lost tourism revenue. It's true
        that the number of Chinese tourists, which normally make up the biggest group of international tourists in
        Thailand (a quarter to a third of all international tourists), fell significantly after the tragedy and only
        picked up in the last quarter of that year.

        When the airlines need pilot cutbacks, policies vary depending on each airline.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"Some airlines use the performance of each pilot as the criteria,"</span> says Sanong. While
        Tom, Pete and Mark say it is possible for either new pilots or senior captains to be selected in cutback
        process, but with different procedures. New pilots can be dismissed easily because the severance pay depends on
        how long the employee has worked for the company. Severance pay for new pilots will be less than for other
        pilots. On the other hand, senior captains may be offered early retirement packages to entice them to leave the
        company. Senior staffs' salary tends to be more expensive so it can be useful for the company to eliminate
        redundancies by paying them off to leave.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Mark also reveals that the company which his friend is working with has offered an unpaid leave period with
        additional allowance for the pilots who have not been selected because of their performance. If they do not
        agree with this package, their working contract will be terminated, and they have to select amount of severance
        pay they want. However, the amount of severance pay they choose affects the chance that they may be called back
        to work in the same company in the future.

        Although domestic flights in Thailand have resumed, international flights are still far from recovery. There are
        a limited number of out-bound flights, and international flight arrivals are restricted by many conditions.

        <span class="quote">"We may see the recovery of the domestic market before the end of this year,"</span> says
        Sanong. However, he says that another factor which affects international aviation is the situation of the
        outbreak in other countries.

        On the other hand, eight airlines in Thailand have requested a $768 million soft loan from the government, and
        the Permanent Secretary for Finance <a href="https://www.prachachat.net/finance/news-515519" target="_blank">said</a> that there
        will be some conclusions about soft loan providing in
        October. Sanong also emphasises that the aviation industry needs more support from the government, especially
        when it cannot lay off employees easily as same as other industries due to difficulties in recruiting staff.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"Employees in some airlines like Thai Airways and Thai Smile Airways cannot get social
            security benefits due to their status as state enterprise employees. This meant the people in this industry
            were overlooked by the government."</span> says Sanong. He added that he already filed a letter to the
        government sector to request for other helping measures, but there is no response until now.

    <div class="content">
        Despite the unclear future, he still believes pilot is a job with high security although he believes it will
        take two years to have vacant positions in the labour market for current unemployed pilots.

    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"It will be hard in these two years to find a job, but when the industry rebounds, the
            airlines will still need them. That's because they are only the people with the license to fly"</span> he
        says <span class="quote">"If Thailand maintains its tourism, investment, and travelling, aviation will still
            exist, until we have another better technology to travel. There is no other vehicle which is quicker than
            the plane now."</span>

        Nonetheless, for Tom, Pete, and Mark, if someone tells them that he or she wants to be a pilot, they will warn
        that person to think again.

        <span class="quote">"If you apply for the scholarship to study aviation from the airline companies which
            guarantees your job, that's ok. However, the problem is, no airline gives this kind of scholarship nowadays.
            And if you want to apply to be a student pilot directly without a job guarantee, you really shouldn't do
            that, unless you have surplus money and can afford to take a year off"</span>, advises Pete.
