                The accommodation is one of the essential parts of tourism, which uses a lot of workforces. Hence, the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has not only made the troubles for the entrepreneurs but also made the job security of more than a million employees all around the country to be unstable.

        'A painful period' for employees and entrepreneurs
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"My financial status was affected because I just came back from a vacation, then had worked for a month and was laid off,"</span> says <span class="superstrong">Patcharida Wangmooklang</span>, a former receptionist of Bed and Ink Hostel in Koh Tao Island, Surat Thani province in the southern region of Thailand. She is one of many employees who were laid off from the hostel. She has now moved to work as a project manager in another travel agency under the same company, but it took more than two months before her new job will be assigned. 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        She adds that the outbreak made all of the customers in the hotel return to their countries, and the social distancing measures have been introduced, <span class="quote">"These made many hostels have been shut down gradually, including my hostel,"</span> She also suspects that her hostel will be closed permanently.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        She tells us that she did not get any salary during the unemployed period and had to use her savings in this challenging time without any other sources of income. Fortunately, her boss still provided her with the accommodation and a meal per day, <span class="quote">"In that time I almost decided to return home in Bangkok. However, my boss gave me a new job, so I decided to continue working here."</span>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The similar situation happened with another accommodation owner in Mae Sot district, Tak Province, in the western region. <span class="superstrong">Chalermwut Wangburapapaiboon</span>, the owner of Sleep Nest hostel, says that he has no customer since March until now. One of his two housekeepers decided to leave the job at the same period, and he decided to temporarily unemployed another housekeeper as well. He also explains that some hotels have been closed, while some hotels cut the price, that made his hostel cannot compete.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"I already adjusted my plan to make this hostel to be a long-stay accommodation service instead, but the rental is under negotiation,"</span> He accepts. With this plan, his housekeeper will continue to take care of the accommodation as a service for tenants.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        He has not to pay for his employee. Nonetheless, he also instated a moratorium on the debt that his employee borrowed his money as well, to help her in this difficult time.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        This kind of difficulty happened everywhere. The accommodation businesses have suffered a lot from this pandemic period. The data from Thailand's Ministry of Tourism and Sports revealed that the occupancy rate of accommodations in Thailand dropped dramatically in the first four months of 2020 and has gradually risen from May. However, the latest occupancy rate in July was still much lower than in the same period in 2018 and 2019.

    </div>
    <div class="content">
        This challenging period also made a plan to launch a new hotel business has been postponed. <span class="superstrong">Watcharaphan Bunnag</span>, a marketing officer at the Tourism Authority of Thailand which is going to launch his own hotel business in Pattaya city, tells us that he had to postpone his schedule to launch his new hotel to be in October 2020 due to curfew which was in effect during April to June, and the state of emergency in Thailand which has been in effect since late March until nowadays. He also has to temporarily stop his own Airbnb house leasing business in Bangkok as well.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        From the study of <span class="superstrong">Kiriya Kulkonkarn</span>, an associate professor from Thammasat University in Thailand, she found that the accommodation industry is the only one industry which has the highest number of employees (more than one million employees) and sees the highest impact from COVID-19. As a part of the study, she conducted an online survey with 472 Thai workers in the tourism accommodation industry in May 2020, to see the impact of COVID-19 on their jobs. More than half of them answered their salary was cut, while only 2.3% of them responded that they were not affected by this crisis.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        This study also reveals that the employers try to use the soft measures first such as forcing their employees to take days off or working days reduction, and then follow by more tough measures such as salary reduction, temporarily laying off, and permanently laying off.
    </div>
    <div class="vis">
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/3671485" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/3671485/embed" aria-label=""><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The answers from workers indicate that the employees who left or had to leave the jobs permanently are the minority group. However, not only the jobs which have been protected, but we also see the attempts to protect the businesses from being shut down permanently. Statistics from Thailand's Department of Business Development reveals that there is no significant increase in the number of hotel and resort hotel businesses which have gone out of business from 2018 to 2020. However, the number which has fallen in 2020 is the number of newly registered hotel and resort hotel businesses. It fell into less than a half in the second quarter when compared to 2018 and 2019. This may affect new hiring in 2020 as well.

    <div class="subtopic subtopic-5">
        Who will be the most affected person(s)?
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The more important question is who will be affected most easily during this crisis. Kiriya's study result explained that the employees with lower age would be riskier to be laid off. Their working days, salary and welfares may be decreased easier than the people in higher age due to their low expertise. However, Kiriya also explains in <a href="https://thaipublica.org/2020/07/thaipublica-podcast-ep10/" target="_blank">an episode of ThaiPublica's podcast</a> that after the impact has been existing for a long time, employees in every age range can be affected.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The study result also indicates that the employees with lower salary rate have a higher chance to be temporarily laid off. Meanwhile, the employees with a lower educational background or the female employees have a higher chance to face welfare cuts. The employees in operational levels have a higher chance to be forced to leave or to be temporarily laid off when compared to managers and executives. Lastly, the employees who work in the kitchen also have a higher chance to be laid off when compared to other functions.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        However, the situation we heard from an interview maybe a little bit different from the study result. <span class="superstrong">Tanyatorn Suppakittiwong</span>, a senior associate at a Asset Management in Bangkok, provides us with a case study about laying employee off during this challenging time. Her company acts like an owner for many hotels in leading tourism provinces and cities such as Bangkok, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Pattaya, and Surat Thani. She gives an example from a hotel in Bangkok under her responsibility, says that the main group of customers in this hotel is foreigners. The pandemic made the number of customers gradually fell until it has been below the break-even point since April. The management decided to close the hotel temporarily from that point, which made a lot of variable costs could be cut.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Nonetheless, the employees' salary still has been the main fixed costs which could not be cut, and the labour protection law defines that employers have to pay at least 75% of regular salary to their employees during the temporary shutdown period. Even though the office of social security provided special subsidies for the employees, which helped the employers did not have to pay any salary during the subsidy period, but that period was only a limited time. The foreign customers have not come back yet, and the employers still had to carry a heavy burden from paying salary. That was the cause of laying employees off, and there must be a process to select unlucky employees who had to go.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The logic behind this process was so simple. The asset management expects that the hotel can be opened as usual from next year or at least six months from interview date, considered by using the news about vaccine invention, <span class="quote">"So, if we found that we will have to pay severance pay for an employee more than six times of monthly salary, we will keep that staff. But if we have to pay less than six times of monthly salary, we will let that staff go,"</span> adds Tanyatorn.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Another interesting point is, the asset management decided to keep several executives to continue working in the hotel, except the chief executive officer (CEO). The reason is the hotel has to pay 'too high' salary for that position, while other executives can still run the business.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"We previously had 80 employees before temporary closing, and we decided to terminate the employment contracts of 44 employees,"</span> she concludes.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        For general hotel employees in Thailand who were laid off, Kiriya's study result also reveals that they face several problems including unfair dismissal, lack of knowledge about related law, slow processes and lack of communications from the social security system, lack of income, unemployment, debt, poor mental health, and uncertainties in their future. 60% of all employees in this study answered they feel that their current debts are 'heaviest' and 'very heavy' burdens of them, while 43% of them answered their mental health is in 'poor' condition.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        From the entrepreneurs' side, the study result explains that the hotel in the areas which depend on the receipt from foreign tourists more than Thai tourists will see the higher impact. This explanation is in line with the information from Tanyatorn. As we mentioned earlier, the hotel under her responsibility in Bangkok still has not been reopened yet. At the same time, she also explains that some of the other hotels under her responsibility in several provinces or districts such as Phuket, Hua Hin, Pattaya, and Samui Island, which depend heavily on the receipt from international tourists, still get lower income than usual or even have no income.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        However, the income may not depend only on the proportion of Thai and international tourists. Tanyatorn says that the income from food and beverage business can be another factor which can support hotel businesses when the hotels are closed, <span class="quote">"If the hotel has its restaurant in a separate area which isolated from the hotel, it will be unnecessary that the restaurants' customers have to be hotel customers in the same time,"</span> she explains, So, the restaurant can continue opening."
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        There is another opinion from <span class="superstrong">Kittipong Rueanthip</span>, Senior Economist at Krungthai COMPASS research centre in Thailand. He analyses that survival of hotels depend on the amount of capital each hotel has. He also explains, using an example scenario happened before in the USA, that the economy-class hotels will see a quicker recovery than 4- or 5-star hotels after lockdown measures were eased.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"The explanation for this scenario is, when there is no business trip, the people will not like to go to stay in luxury hotels," he says, <span class="quote">"We have to set an assumption that we don't normally use economy-class hotels in business trips, but we use better hotels." 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        He adds that big hotels may be affected more than small hotels if they have a significant proportion of revenue from space rental business for events and seminars. He says that both the private and public sectors do not tend to support holding events and workshops during this challenging period.
    </div>
    <div class="subtopic subtopic-5">
        The things you need to survive at this difficult time
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        What are the qualifications of employees who will survive in this industry in the future? Kiriya's study suggested the workforce in this industry has to develop multitasking skills and skills related to technologies, or even finding the second job because the employers will use more technologies to improve their services. The employers who responded to the survey in this study also said that the employees have to adjust their mindset, have the flexibility to work across departments.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        These suggestions are in line with Patcharida's opinion. She says, as a former receptionist in a hostel who moved to work as a project manager, that she can adapt the knowledge she got from her bachelor's degree in economics to work with both positions. She also suggests that the people who work in the hotel should have various skills such as backend services, reception, operation, or marketing.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"I think every company is now trying to be lean organisations. So, to be a multitasker will help you to serve employers' needs better,"</span> says Patcharida.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        However, Kiriya's study result indicates that only 29% of all employees who responded to the survey started their second job, while only 14% of all employees learned new skills. More than one-fourth of all employees answered that they still want to work in this industry if they are laid off.
    </div>
    <div class="vis">
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/3726708" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/3726708/embed" aria-label=""><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Not only the employees who have to improve themselves, but the entrepreneurs also have to adjust their business approaches or set up new practices as well. Some changes already happened, and some changes are expected to occur in the future. <span class="superstrong">Nopharat Roothomnong</span>, the owner of Retro Twin Home, a guesthouse in Mae Sot district in the northern region of Thailand, explains that he provides alcohol gel, and used to provide surgical masks for his customers. He normally deep cleans all rooms in his guesthouse, then sanitises the rooms using alcohol spray, and sets up social distancing measures.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        He also made his hotel to be certified under a national standard named 'Amazing Thailand Safety & Health Administration (SHA)'. This standard was set up by Thailand's Ministry of Tourism and Sports and Ministry of Public Health, for ten categories of tourism-related businesses in Thailand such as accommodation, shopping centre, tour operator, and transportation. This standard is also mentioned in an interview by <span class="superstrong">Phuriwat Limthavornrat</span>, president of the Association of Domestic Travel, that the entrepreneurs should try to do their businesses to be certified. The official data reveals that there are more than 5,000 tourism-related businesses in Thailand which have been certified under this standard, and a half of them are the businesses about accommodations or convention halls.
    </div>
    <div class="vis">
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/3726787" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/3726787/embed" aria-label=""><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Meanwhile, Tanyatorn, as an employer in an asset management company which acts like hotels owner, explains that some hotels have stopped serving breakfast for their customers in common areas and serve it directly to customers' room instead. The hotels also have to create 'hygienic' image through their promotions and apply technologies, such as a self check-in system, in their process to decrease physical contacts. In addition, they deep clean their common areas every specific period, such as every two hours and keep enforcing social distancing measures.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        She adds that there may be some other investments in safety and health measures if it is worthy of attracting more customers, such as the buttons pressed by foot in the elevators.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        There are some other interesting revenue models in this challenging time as well. Kittipong says that some small hotels can change their restaurant's kitchen to be a new form of the kitchen, which allows external restaurants to hire. Hence, the food delivery drivers can get the foods which are ordered by their customer quicker than getting from head restaurants. This model becomes more prevalent in Thailand nowadays.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Additionally, Tanyatorn explains us another revenue model which is used in her team, that some hotels intend to get 20-30% of revenue from long stay guests. These guests typically stay in an extended period, such as one or three months. She says that the income per customer's head from long-stay service may be less than daily room service. Nevertheless, long-stay service also has lower risk and may be able to guarantee that those hotels will be able to collect a specific amount of income this pandemic period.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"Then we can focus on other segments of customers who pay the room service fee in the daily or corporate rate, which are more expensive. We do this to maximise our revenue."</span> Tanyatorn concludes.
    </div>
    <div class="subtopic subtopic-5">
        Reflections on government's burden
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        The employers in the tourism accommodation industry also express their expectations to the government. Chalermwut suggests that government should put their efforts to help small business owners who have less capital. The government's help can be subsidising of water and electricity bills, or the help about land rentals. He thinks these measures will give benefits to people thoroughly.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        Nopharat says that he expects the government to allow international commercial flights soon. However, he thinks that social distancing measures still essential. Kiriya's study reflects the employers' demand about international commercial flights acceptance as well. She explained in <a href="https://thaipublica.org/2020/07/thaipublica-podcast-ep10/" target="_blank">the podcast</a> that they want the government to start welcoming tourists from the countries which have low infection rate first because there will be a very high competition among businesses if there are only Thai tourists.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        About the help and measures already provided by the government, Tanyatorn also has her expectation about the two campaigns for tourism stimulation ('We travel together' and 'Encouragement') aside from thinking of the benefits from the social security system. She believes these two campaigns will be effective to some extent and will make people want to travel. However, she emphasises that the COVID-19 outbreak also has decreased the people's purchasing power.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <span class="quote">"There is no 'sufficiency' about the supports, but the things government have done already helped us in some parts,"</span> she answers when we asked about other measures which the government should do more.
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        In the employees' side, the online survey result from Kiriya's study indicates that most of the employees responded to this survey answered that they were helped by the benefits of the social security system. However, 40% of all employees said they have the lowest level of satisfaction with the government's measures during the crisis. There are several problems they raised with Kiriya in the study. For example, the measures government provided are insufficient, the measures are not cover migrant workers, although they are legal, and the labour dispute reconciliation process between employees and employers takes a too long time.
